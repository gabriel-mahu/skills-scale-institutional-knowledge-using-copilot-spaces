# OctoAcme Project Management Docs Overview

## Summary of Project Management Processes

OctoAcme utilizes a structured, transparent approach to project management, enabling repeatable delivery and collaborative improvement across cross-functional teams. The process lifecycle includes **initiation**, **planning**, **execution**, **release & deployment**, and **retrospective/continuous improvement**.

Projects begin by validating business needs, aligning stakeholders, and agreeing on success metrics through a Project One-pager. Planning emphasizes breaking down deliverables into actionable increments, identifying dependencies and risks, and creating prioritized backlogs—ensuring clarity across roles. Execution is guided by regular standups, syncs, and board-based workflows. Risk management is handled proactively: risks are logged, assessed, mitigated, and escalated by protocol. Releases follow documented checklists for staging, smoke tests, communication, and rollbacks.

**Key Roles & Personas**  
- Project Manager (PM): Coordinates schedules, risks, and communications  
- Product Manager (PdM): Owns product vision, prioritizes backlog, measures outcomes  
- Developers: Build features, maintain quality, participate in reviews and technical planning  
- QA/Testing: Validate acceptance criteria, run automated and manual checks  
- Stakeholders: Supply input, feedback, and approvals

**Communication Strategies & Quality Assurance**  
Communication is maintained via weekly PM/PdM syncs, delivery standups, and stakeholder updates, with project boards and risk registers providing a single source of truth. Blockers are escalated via team/PM/Product Lead/Sponsor tiers. Every phase integrates automated CI tests (unit, integration, security), manual QA for key flows, and post-release retrospectives for actionable improvements. Learnings are tracked and fed back into the process docs for continuous improvement.
