# OctoAcme — Design Review Checklist

## Purpose
Ensure UX designs are reviewed systematically for usability, accessibility, technical feasibility, and alignment with product goals before implementation.

## When to use
Before finalizing designs for developer handoff, and when significant UI/UX changes are proposed.

## Pre-Review Preparation
- [ ] Design mockups or prototypes ready
- [ ] User research insights documented (if applicable)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria from Product Manager available
- [ ] Technical constraints identified

## Design Review Checklist

### User Experience
- [ ] Design solves the stated problem clearly
- [ ] User flows are intuitive and logical
- [ ] Navigation patterns are consistent with existing product
- [ ] Error states and edge cases are addressed
- [ ] Loading states and transitions are defined

### Accessibility
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- [ ] Text is readable and scalable
- [ ] Interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Screen reader support considerations documented
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible and clear

### Visual Design
- [ ] Design follows established design system
- [ ] Typography, spacing, and colors are consistent
- [ ] Icons and imagery are appropriate and licensed
- [ ] Responsive design for different screen sizes addressed
- [ ] Dark mode/theme variations considered (if applicable)

### Technical Feasibility
- [ ] Design can be implemented with existing tech stack
- [ ] Performance implications discussed (animations, assets)
- [ ] API or data requirements identified
- [ ] Third-party dependencies noted
- [ ] Browser/platform compatibility requirements clear

### Business & Product Alignment
- [ ] Design meets acceptance criteria
- [ ] Success metrics can be measured
- [ ] Stakeholder feedback incorporated
- [ ] Legal/compliance requirements addressed
- [ ] Localization and internationalization considered

## Review Participants
- **Required**: UX Designer, Product Manager, Lead Developer
- **Optional**: Project Manager, QA Engineer, Accessibility Specialist

## Post-Review Actions
- [ ] Design approved or revision plan documented
- [ ] Design specifications updated based on feedback
- [ ] Assets and documentation prepared for handoff
- [ ] Implementation story/task created with design links
- [ ] Timeline for implementation agreed upon

## Design Handoff Deliverables
- Annotated mockups or prototypes
- Design specifications (spacing, colors, typography)
- Asset exports (icons, images, logos)
- Interaction documentation (animations, transitions)
- Edge case and error state definitions

## Follow-up
- [ ] Designer available for questions during implementation
- [ ] Design validation scheduled after implementation
- [ ] User testing planned for post-implementation (if needed)
